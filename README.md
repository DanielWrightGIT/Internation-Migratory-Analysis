The purpose of our study is to help offset migratory fatalities using machine learning, specifically a time series model to predict and prevent seasonal deaths during internation migration.

Users may interact with our interface by selecting their anticipated date of migration and the route that they intend to travel from the drop down boxes.

After these selections are made the application will show the user the level of danger associated with the date selected and a predicted amount of indidents(death/serious injury) that will occur based on the time and location parameters.  


Thanks for visiting, safe travels!
