# finalApp


This project was conducted by Daniel Wright, Leticia Montilla, and Teri Nyugen-Shank of the Penn State University MPS DAAN program.


**Access the application at this link:     https://internation-migratory-analysis-tvgoqjc8dxjyc59mnfm4w4.streamlit.app/ **


The purpose of our study is to help offset migratory fatalities using machine learning, specifically a time series model to predict and prevent seasonal deaths during internation migration.

Users may interact with the interface by selecting their anticipated date of migration and the route that they intend to travel from the drop down boxes.

After these selections are made the application will show you the level of danger associated with the date selected and a predicted amount of indidents(death/serious injury) that will occur based on the time and location parameters. Additionally there is a histogram breaking down the types of incidents that can be anticipated.


Thanks for visiting, safe travels!
